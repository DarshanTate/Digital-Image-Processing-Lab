# Bit Plane Slicing Image Analysis

## Overview
This MATLAB script performs bit plane slicing on an input image, extracting and visualizing individual bit planes from grayscale images.

## Features
- Converts color images to grayscale
- Extracts 8 individual bit planes from an image
- Displays the original image and each bit plane
- Supports both RGB and grayscale input images

## Instruction
- Place your input image (img.png) in the same directory as the script
- Run the script
- A figure will display the original image and 8 bit planes labeled from Least Significant Bit (LSB) to Most Significant Bit (MSB)

## Bit Plane Visualization
- LSB (Least Significant Bit): Contains least important image information
- MSB (Most Significant Bit): Contains most critical image details
- Intermediate bit planes show progressive image complexity

## Output

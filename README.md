## Practicals So Far

1. RGB_Component_Extraction_And_Analysis: Read an image, split it into RGB channels and convert it to grayscale.
2. Histogram Equalization: Perform histogram equalization on a grayscale image.
3. Bit plane Slicing : Performs bit plane slicing on an input image, extracting and visualizing individual bit planes from grayscale images.
4. Shannon-Fano Encoding : Implements Shannon-Fano coding to generate binary codes for symbols based on their probabilities, optimizing for minimal average code length. Displays 
   symbols, probabilities, and corresponding codes.
